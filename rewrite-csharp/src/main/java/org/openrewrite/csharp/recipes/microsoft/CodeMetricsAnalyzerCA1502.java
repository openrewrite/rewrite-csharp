Cyclomatic complexity measures the number of linearly independent paths through the method, which is determined by the number and complexity of conditional branches. A low cyclomatic complexity generally indicates a method that is easy to understand, test, and maintain. The cyclomatic complexity is calculated from a control flow graph of the method and is given as follows: `cyclomatic complexity = the number of edges - the number of nodes + 1`, where a node represents a logic branch point and an edge represents a line between nodes.";
