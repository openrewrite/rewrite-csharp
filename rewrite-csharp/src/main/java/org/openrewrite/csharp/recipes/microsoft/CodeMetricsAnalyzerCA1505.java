Program volume is a measure of the difficulty of understanding of a symbol that is based on the number of operators and operands in the code. Cyclomatic complexity is a measure of the structural complexity of the type or method. A low maintainability index indicates that code is probably difficult to maintain and would be a good candidate to redesign.";
